I'm deeply and sincerely sorry. I'm sorry for being annoying over the communication app Discord. I will be sure to deeply reflect on my actions and their apparent consequences and how they impact other people. I don't ask for forgiveness, I merely want you to understand that I regret my behaviour. Thank you for understanding.
